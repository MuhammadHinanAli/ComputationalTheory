    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function generates the first `n` prime numbers using the efficient Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It marks the multiples of each prime starting from `2` as non-prime and collects the remaining numbers as primes. The function uses a fixed upper limit to ensure enough primes are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n` (int): The number of prime numbers to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - A list `is_prime` of size 600 is created to track whether numbers are prime. All values are initialized to `True`, except for indices 0 and 1, which are marked as `False` since 0 and 1 are not prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sieve Process:**\n",
    "   - Starting from `2`, the algorithm marks the multiples of each prime as `False`, effectively eliminating non-prime numbers.\n",
    "   - This continues up to the square root of the upper limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extracting Primes:**\n",
    "   - Once the sieve is complete, the indices of `True` values in the `is_prime` list represent prime numbers.\n",
    "   - The first `n` primes are extracted and returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result:**\n",
    "   - The first `n` prime numbers are returned as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return Value\n",
    "\n",
    "- A list of the first `n` prime numbers.\n"

    "#### **Overview:**\n",
    "The code reads a file named `words.txt`, processes each line to extract words that contain only alphabetic characters, and then identifies the word with the most leading zeros in its corresponding SHA-256 hash. This could be useful for various applications, such as selecting the \"best\" word in terms of difficulty or computational challenges (e.g., hashing challenges or cryptographic applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Functionality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Reading:**\n",
    "   - The code opens the file `words.txt` and reads its contents line by line.\n",
    "   - It strips any surrounding whitespace from each line and only includes the word if it consists of alphabetic characters (no digits or symbols).\n",
    "   - The valid words are stored in the list `word_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tracking the Word with Most Leading Zeros:**\n",
    "   - Two variables are initialized: `best_word` (to track the word with the most leading zeros) and `max_zeros` (to store the maximum number of leading zeros encountered).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Iterating through the Word List:**\n",
    "   - For each word in `word_list`, the function `leading_zeros(word)` is called to count the number of leading zeros in the SHA-256 hash of the word.\n",
    "   - If the current word has more leading zeros than the previously found maximum, the word is updated as the new `best_word`, and `max_zeros` is updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output:**  \n",
    "   - The final output will be the word (`best_word`) with the most leading zeros in its SHA-256 hash."
