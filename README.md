# **COMPUTATIONAL THEORY**

This repository contains a set of Python scripts and functions that address four main tasks involving **bitwise operations**, **hash functions**, **SHA-256 padding**, and **prime-number computation**. Each task is described in detail below, along with references, test procedures, and example usage.

## **Table of Contents**
1. Task 1: Binary Representation (32-bit Bitwise Operations)

2. Task 2: Kernighan and Ritchie Hash Function

3. Task 3: SHA-256 Padding Calculation

4. Task 4: Calculating the First 100 Prime Numbers

5. Task 5: Extracting 32 Bits of Fractional Parts of Square Roots for the First 100 Primes

6. Task 6: Finding Words with Maximum Leading Zero Bits in Their SHA256 Hash 

7. Task 7: Turing Machines

8. Task 8: Computational Complexity
