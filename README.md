# **Detailed README**

This repository contains a set of Python scripts and functions that address four main tasks involving **bitwise operations**, **hash functions**, **SHA-256 padding**, and **prime-number computation**. Each task is described in detail below, along with references, test procedures, and example usage.

## **Table of Contents**
1. Task 1: Binary Representation (32-bit Bitwise Operations)

2. Task 2: Kernighan and Ritchie Hash Function

3. Task 3: SHA-256 Padding Calculation

4. Task 4: Calculating the First 100 Prime Numbers
